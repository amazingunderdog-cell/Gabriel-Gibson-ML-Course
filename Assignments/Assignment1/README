# Assignment 1

## Problem
The goal of this assignment was to build a simple machine learning model to predict housing prices.

## Approach
- Loaded the dataset  
- Cleaned the data and removed missing values  
- Used a linear regression model  
- Compared the predictions with actual values  

## Results
The model produced reasonable results and helped me understand how data preparation affects accuracy.

## What I Learned
I learned the importance of preprocessing and how small changes in the data can influence the outcome of the model.
