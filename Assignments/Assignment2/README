# Assignment 2

## Problem
This assignment focused on evaluating a classification model and comparing accuracy across different approaches.

## Approach
- Loaded and reviewed the dataset  
- Prepared features for training  
- Trained a classification model  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix  

## Results
The model performed better after adjusting the input features. This showed how feature selection affects outcomes.

## What I Learned
I learned how evaluation metrics help determine whether a model is performing well and what adjustments may be needed.
