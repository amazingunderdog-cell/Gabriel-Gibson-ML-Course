# Lab 2

This lab introduced basic preprocessing steps and simple machine learning concepts. I practiced preparing data for modeling and reviewing output results.

## What I Learned
- How to handle missing values  
- How to split data into training and testing sets  
- How to run a basic model and check predictions  

## Challenges
I had to repeat a few steps to understand how the data splitting worked, but reviewing the notebook helped reinforce the process.
