# Lab 1

In this lab, I learned how to load data, view basic information about a dataset, and perform simple exploratory steps. I also practiced using Jupyter Notebook to run code and document the results.

## What I Learned
- How to load data into a notebook  
- How to inspect dataset columns and values  
- How to run cells and manage the notebook environment  

## Challenges
At first I had trouble understanding how the notebook structure works, but after some practice it became easier to navigate and run code.
